## Introduction

In this project, we were tasked to write a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line!

As a user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, we were tasked to break the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.

Through each iteration, we were asked to use TDD to drive implementation of your code.

## Technologies

- Javascript
- node.js
- VS Code
- mocha 
- chai
